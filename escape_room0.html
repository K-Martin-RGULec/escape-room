            <p>After a few hours of sleep and rest, you wake up and stretch your aching limbs. The cold floor of the laboratory is really not the best place for a refreshing sleep… wait a minute… why are you here?
                You remember attending an on-campus laboratory session the day before, but what happened? You met Dr Robert Gordon, a critically acclaimed scientist who was researching a new drug for enhancing memory. The last thing you remember is that you were in the lab with Dr Gordon and your group were finishing an experiment. The result of mixing two chemicals appears to have had the opposite effect than intended. You can remember anything after a small explosion which released a plume of sweet-smelling purple gas into the air.
                You run to the door to try to exit the laboratory, and realise you are locked inside. Dr Gordon is nowhere to be seen, but he has left a hastily written note for you on the whiteboard.</p>
                <p>Note:</p>
                <p>‘Dear students,</p>
                <p>I’m sorry that the experiment did not go to plan. After months of experimenting and countless failed analysis I have finally found the answer! I have created a new drug that results in super memory. The components required for this are rare, and I have had some trouble sourcing the correct quantities. As you can appreciate I must keep this top secret until I receive the patent, otherwise the recipe may be stolen by competing groups. I had to make a hasty escape as something didn’t feel right, I will explain all when you find me. I have hidden some components in my backpack.
                I’ve got an uneasy feeling that we are being watched. If you don’t hear from me by Wednesday, open my safe deposit box (CLUE). I have taken all the necessary precautions, wish me luck.
                See you soon!</p>
                
                <p>Dr Gordon’</p>
