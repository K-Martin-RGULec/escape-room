            <h1>Welcome to Escape from RGU!</h1>
            <p>This is an online escape room designed to recap on some of the things you have learned over the course of the day while having fun.</p>
            <p>Like other escape rooms, the way to solve individual rooms is not always obvious. Try to think around the problem and use all the resources on the page to help you find a solution. A few tips and tricks before you start on your adventure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're stuck, look all around the page to help you find clues. Then use a combination of those clues and your own knowledge to help you crack the code.</li>
                <li>None of the clues require you to leave the escape room website. That said, do feel free to use Google to help you find answers once you have cracked the clues.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, have fun!</li>
            </ul>
